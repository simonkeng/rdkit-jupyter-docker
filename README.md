# RDKit + Chem + Conda + Jupyter + Docker

Easily run a Jupyter notebook in Python 3, with all the RDKit dependencies and packages baked in. I hope this provides an "out of the box" solution for anyone who would like to replicate  [this](http://asteeves.github.io/blog/2015/01/12/molecules-in-rdkit/) or [this](https://github.com/rdkit/UGM_2016/blob/master/Notebooks/Brief%20Introduction.ipynb), but does not want to spend time installing packages, dealing with conda envs, dependencies, and getting all the right pieces talking for RDKit and Jupyter to live happily together.

## Instructions

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/simonkeng/rdkit-jupyter-docker.git`
3. Build docker image from Dockerfile

```bash
docker build -t run_rdkit_conda .
```

4. Run the docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 -t run_rdkit_conda /bin/bash -c "jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=/tmp --ip=* --allow-root"
```

5. Docker will return a container ID, type `docker logs <id>` passing in the first three characters from the id.

6. You should be able to directly copy the URL from the Jupyter log, and visit that URL in your browser. This _should_ work, but if it doesn't, see step 7.  

7. If your URL looks something like this:

```
http://11140d529dec:8888/?token=6ae1624a03f82e5592feaa5123b4086a5dc4f54ed6f6fe8b
```

Then replace right after `http://` (in this example: `11140d529dec`), with `127.0.0.1`. The final URL should look like

```
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=6ae1624a03f82e5592feaa5123b4086a5dc4f54ed6f6fe8b
```

..but with your token instead of mine. **Note** this is a Jupyter bug right now, so its very likely that this step won't be necessary by the time you run the container.

### Once you're in:

These lines are useful for getting started with RDKit in Jupyter. 

```python
import rdkit
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import AllChem
from rdkit.Chem import Draw
from rdkit.Chem.Draw import IPythonConsole
from IPython.display import Image
```

### Caveats
If you are running any other processes on port 8888 (e.g. another Jupyter notebook) then you will likely have problems connecting to the containerized notebook in the browser. I recommend shutting down any other Jupyter notebooks first, before running `docker run`.

## Acknowledgement

This implementation was forked from Greg Landrum's [rdkit containers](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit_containers/tree/master/docker/run_conda3) repo, but I've tweaked it a bit and updated the things that didn't work for me initially, in hopes to provide an "out of the box" build, relevant to May 2018 developers. All credit goes to Greg and the other RDKit devs.


Docker Compose
===

Once steps 1 and 2 of the [Instuctions](#instructions) sections have been
completed you can use docker-compose to complete steps 3-7:

Step 3:

```bash
docker-compose --build
```

Step 4-7:
```bash
# start container with logs output to terminal
docker-compose up

# or start container in background
docker-compose up -d

# output the container logs
docker-compose logs -f
```
